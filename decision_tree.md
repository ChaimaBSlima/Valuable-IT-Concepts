**Decision trees** belong to the world of **supervised machine learning algorithms**. We are given a set of individuals, and for each of these individuals, some features are defined.

One of these features is the **target feature** : for an individual we want to predict the value of the target feature from the other features, that are consequently considered as **explanatory features** (often, the target feature is called the dependent feature while the other features are called the independent features).

**Example :** in the following example we have two explanatory features (sex and annual income) and the target is whether or not the individual bought a certain product. Our aim is to predict whether Jim will buy the product.

In this situation the decision tree would look like

and since Jim is a male and has an income larger than 30000, we would predict that Jim doesnâ€™t buy the product.
